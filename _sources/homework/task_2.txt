Homework Task 2: Gitting to Know You
------------------------------------

**Tell Us About Yourself**

This is a way for you to learn a bit about gitHub, and how you are going to
submit most of your homework.

* Create a new folder in the ``students`` folder in the class repository.

  * Create the folder in your clone of your fork of the repository.
  * Name it with your own name in CamelCase, like: ``ChrisBarker``.
  * In the folder create one new file, named ``README.md`` (or ``README.rst``)
  * In that new file, write up a few paragraphs about yourself.

    * Use proper `markdown`_ syntax. (or `reStructuredText`_)
    * Include at least two headings, of different levels.
    * Include at least one link.

* Using ``git add``, add the new folder and file to your clone of the
  repository.
* Using ``git commit``, commit your changes to your clone (write a good commit
  message). If you later edit your file, don't forget to commit those changes
  too.
* Using ``git push``, push your commits to your fork on GitHub.
* In GitHub's Web UI, make a ``pull request`` to the original CodeFellows
  repository.

Remember, GitHub is a public place.  Your work in this repository is visible to
the world.
